# **Exercise 4.1** #

Implement a function named getNumber which generates a random number. If randomNumber is divisible by 5 it will reject the promise else it will resolve the promise. 

Letâ€™s also keep the promise resolution/rejection time as a variable.

1. JS promises should not be used.

2. A custom promise function should be created.

3. This function should be able to handle all 3 states Resolve, Reject and Fulfilled.

4. Should be able to accept callbacks as props.
